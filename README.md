# colonel_in_a_maze_A_star_alg
In this repository, there will be a program with the same requirements as in colonel_in_a_maze repository, but using A* algorithm. Additionally, the winning plan will be optimal (not longer than any other winning plan). Tests for this program will be constructed in such a way that stage 1), reducing uncertainty, will not be necessary.

Input file: zad_input.txt
Output file: zad_output.txt

To run all tests: python validator.py zad5 python main.py
